TOMMY BOT
// Tommy Bot / Design and Product

Who? Samuel Breck, Justin He, Will Durkee (the developers), and me (everything that's not developing), in conjunction with Lavalab, USC's student run startup incubator. 
 
What? A chatbot based on Messenger that answers queries about USC. Currently he can answer questions about building locations, building hours, dining hall options, and campus events. We're always working on expanding his capabilities! I manage all aspects of design and marketing on the team: interaction design, branding, advertising, social media, website, user analytics, etc. Learn more on our site or ask him a question!
 
When? The project was created in the Fall of 2016 as part of Lavalab. My team and I decided to pursue and launch the project after demo night. We're in the first phase of our rollout and are working on optimizing our product with our current users. 
 
Where? The University of Southern California in Los Angeles

Why?  We initially came up with this idea after remembering how difficult it can be to adjust to a new campus as freshmen, so we wanted to create a tool to help students. We quickly realized that this project has huge potential. On the surface level, chatbots can pool from existing information easily accessible on the web, but if we connect it to students’ personal accounts, Tommy Bot could be a hub for students’ grades, available clubs, quickly booking rooms at libraries, and so much more.
 
In the grand scheme. Through Lavalab, we learned about what it takes to take a product from ideation to launch. It's been an amazing and gratifying learning experience, and will definitely continue to be. I pour nearly all of my time into Tommy Bot when I'm not in class, so I have a lot of love for this project. Also, we got some press from the Daily Trojan!

New Skills: Management, social media, pulling all nighters
 
Level Up: Acquired an awesome team. Learned about creating, launching, and managing a product with real users.



A SLIME IN TIME
// A Slime in Time / Marketing

Overview

Who? Ian Glow, Joshua Bollar, Derek Eom, Guayo Llach, Kevin Lei, Uday Chadha, Drew Okenfuss, Christie Xu, Zhaoyang Han, Rachel Emig (all part of USC Cinematic Arts, all game majors), and me!
 
What? A Slime in Time is a Hololens game that Ian (director) and Josh (producer) conceived for their capstone project. The video above is a rough cut that I created to recruit some AI students for the project. 

When? I joined this project a week into the Spring 2017 semester, so it's very new. This video was thrown together literally yesterday (as of Monday January 23, 2017)— I just hopped onto this project so everything is very early in it's phase of creation on my end.
 
Where? The University of Southern California in Los Angeles

Why? Explore the potential of AR technology in the gaming world by bringing traditional 2D game mechanics to the 3D world. 
 
In the grand scheme. I joined this project in the most random way possible— Drew, from the project, reached out to Drake Rehfeld, the managing director of Lavalab in request of an AR UI designer. Drake reached out to me as I’ve had experience doing concept art for VR UI, and I somehow wound up being brought on as marketing lead based on my previous experience rolling out Tommy Bot, as that was the position the team had the most need for. What I've learned this past semester is to accept new, unexpected opportunities as they come and enjoy the ride. 

New Skills: Management, corporate marketing, play testing and usability, Final Cut Pro
 
Level Up: Joined an awesome team. Learning about design and marketing in a gaming context
